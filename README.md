# MaskitLLM â€“ Advanced LLM Sensitive Information Masking Service

## Overview

**MaskitLLM** is a state-of-the-art sensitive information masking service designed to protect private data before transmission to Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT. This service leverages cutting-edge NLP techniques to automatically identify and mask critical information, providing a robust solution for data privacy in AI-driven environments. The initial prototype is implemented using **Streamlit** for rapid iteration and user feedback, while the production version will be built with **FastAPI** for scalability and performance.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Sensitive Data Masking**: Utilizes advanced NLP models to detect and mask a wide range of sensitive information including but not limited to personal identifiers, financial data, and proprietary information.
- **Interactive Text Comparison**: Provides a side-by-side view of original and masked text with highlighting for easy verification.
- **Customizable Masking Rules**: Allows users to define custom masking rules and sensitivity levels tailored to specific use cases or industries.
- **Manual Refinement**: Enables fine-grained control through manual selection and masking of text segments.
- **Secure Export Options**: Offers various secure export formats for seamless integration with LLM pipelines.
- **API Integration**: (Planned) RESTful API for easy integration into existing workflows and applications.

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.9+**: Leveraging the latest language features for robust and efficient code.
- **Streamlit**: For rapid prototyping and interactive testing interface.
- **FastAPI**: High-performance framework for production API deployment.
- **SpaCy**: State-of-the-art NLP library for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and linguistic analysis.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Cutting-edge pre-trained models for advanced NLP tasks.
- **PostgreSQL**: (Planned) For storing user preferences and masking rules.
- **Docker**: For containerization and easy deployment.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker (optional, but recommended for production deployment)
- Git

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kunwookim/maskitllm.git
   cd maskitllm
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install pre-commit hooks for code quality:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

### Running the Service

#### Development (Streamlit):

```bash
streamlit run src/streamlit_app.py
```

#### Production (FastAPI):

```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
```

For containerized deployment:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
